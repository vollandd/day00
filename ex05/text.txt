BLACK.1 1

ELLIOT (V.O.)

Hello friend. Hello friend? That’s lame. Maybe I should give you a name? 
But that’s a slippery slope. You’re only in my head. We have to remember that.
(then)Shit. 
It’s actually happened. I’m talking to an imaginary person.
Loud, violent jazz RISES on the soundtrack. Within the black of frame,
silhouettes begin forming. 

ELLIOT (V.O.)

What I’m about to tell you is top secret. A conspiracy bigger than all of us. 
There’s a powerful group of people out there that are secretly running the world. 
(then)I’m talking about the guys no one knows about. The guys that are invisible. 
The top one percent of the top one percent. The guys that play God without permission.

CUT TO BLACK.

ELLIOT (V.O.)

And now I think they’re following me.

INT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING2 2

We finally meet ELLIOT (late 20s) in a hoodie. He sneaks looks at two mysterious 
MEN DRESSED IN BLACK, one on either side of the train. One reads the NY Post. 
The other looks straight ahead, suspiciously so.

ELLIOT (V.O.)

This is about last night. I should have gone to Angela’s birthday party. Instead I 
went to --

INT/EXT. RON’S COFFEE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK3 3

A small coffee shop with a few patrons. Elliot sits by himself, hoodie on, no coffee. 
He watches a mild-mannered Indian with a mustache walk into the shop. This is RON (40s). 

MR. ROBOT PILOT 1.

(CONTINUED)

A BARISTA brings Ron a latte, which he sips as he reads his iPad. Elliot musters up 
the courage to walk over. He sits across from Ron without saying a word. Finally, 
Ron looks up.

ELLIOT

You’re Ron.
He nervously gestures to the cheesy sign. Confused, Ron just offers a quick smile in 
return--

ELLIOT

But your real name is Rohit Mehta. You changed it to Ron when you bought your first 
Ron’s Coffee Shop six years ago. Now you have seventeen of them with eight more coming
next quarter. 
An awkward silence. Ron licks his lips, concerned.

RON

May I help you with something?

ELLIOT

I liked coming here because your WIFI was fast. You’re one of the few places that has 
a fiber connection with gigabit speed. It’s good. So good, it scratched that part of 
my mind-- the part that doesn’t allow good to exist without condition. So, I started 
intercepting all the traffic on your network and that’s when I noticed something 
strange

--(looks down)That’s when I decided to hack you.
Another awkward silence. Ron goes to say something--

ELLIOT

I know you run a website called Plato’s Boys.

RON

Pardon me?

ELLIOT

You’re using Tor networking to keep the servers anonymous, you made it really hard for
anyone to see it.(beat)But I saw it. 

MR. ROBOT PILOT 2.

(CONTINUED)

The onion routing protocol is not as anonymous as you think it is. Whoever’s in 
control of the exit nodes is also in control of the traffic which makes me the one...
(beat)In control. 

RON

I must ask you to kindly leave.

Ron turns to the man working the register--

ELLIOT

I own everything.

Ron turns around and discovers Elliot’s pulled out a manila folder from his bag. 
Elliot pushes it across the table towards Ron. Ron trembles as he opens the folder.

ELLIOT

All your emails, all your files, all your...pics.
Ron sees that pictures of naked boys fill the folder. He snaps it shut and looks 
around nervously.

RON

Get out of here right now, or I will call the--

ELLIOT

Police? Do you want them to find out about the 100TB of child pornography you serve 
to your 400,000 users?
For a moment, all that can be heard is the soft musak and quiet sipping of coffee 
from the other patrons. Ron looks down, cornered and speechless. 
Elliot looks genuinely sympathetic.

ELLIOT

Personally, man, I was hoping it was just gonna be some BDSM stuff. You realize 
how much simpler that would have been?

RON

I did not hurt anyone, I never did-- that’s my personal life.
He wipes his eyes as emotion begins to fill his face.  

MR. ROBOT PILOT 3.

CONTINUED:3 3ELLIOT (CONT'D)

(CONTINUED)

ELLIOT

I understand what it’s like to be different. I’m very different too. I mean, 
I don’t jerk off to little kids, but... I don’t know how to talk to people. 
My dad was the only one I could talk to. But he died.
Sensing an opportunity, Ron nods sympathetically.

RON

I’m sorry to hear that. How did he pass, may I ask?

ELLIOT

Leukemia. Definitely got it from radiation at the company he worked at, though I 
couldn’t prove it. Now he’s dead. The company’s fine though. 
Ron can’t help but cry. Elliot genuinely feels for him.
 
ELLIOT

Hey, it’s okay, Rohit. You don’t have to worry anymore.

RON

I don’t understand.(off Elliot’s silence)Are you blackmailing me? So that’s what 
this is about. Money. That’s all you care about. No. If I pay you now, you will want 
more and more. No matter how much I give, you will inform the police anyway. 
I won’t pay you, sir. Remember, you also broke the law.
Elliot notices something outside the window and nods.

ELLIOT

Actually, you’re right. Partly. (beat)See, I usually do this kind of thing from my 
computer. This time, I wanted to do it AFK-- in person. I’m trying to work on my 
social anxiety. But there’s always the threat of you fleeing after I call you out. 
You’d tell your sys admin to take the servers down, wipe all the data. 

MR. ROBOT PILOT 4.

(CONTINUED)

So I made sure to include the current time and location on my anonymous tip-

RON

Wait, hold on! I will give you the money. I will pay. How much do you want?! 
I’ll pay you.
Sirens can be heard. Lights swirl outside the windows.

ELLIOT

That’s the part you were wrong about, Rohit. I don’t give a shit about money. 
FBI AGENTS race into the shop as Elliot breezes past them, heading out, 
leaving the chaos to surround the destroyed Ron.
